.SH NAME
.PP
bup\-tag \- tag a commit in the bup repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup tag
.PP
bup tag [\-f] <tag name> <committish>
.PP
bup tag \-d [\-f] <tag name>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\ tag\f[] lists, creates or deletes a tag in the bup repository.
.PP
A tag is an easy way to retrieve a specific commit.
It can be used to mark a specific backup for easier retrieval later.
.PP
When called without any arguments, the command lists all tags that can
be found in the repository.
When called with a tag name and a commit ID or ref name, it creates a
new tag with the given name, if it doesn\[aq]t already exist, that
points to the commit given in the second argument.
When called with \[aq]\-d\[aq] and a tag name, it removes the given tag,
if it exists.
.PP
bup exposes the contents of backups with current tags, via any command
that lists or shows backups.
They can be found under the /.tag directory.
For example, the \[aq]ftp\[aq] command will show the tag named
\[aq]tag1\[aq] under /.tag/tag1.
.PP
Tags are also exposed under the branches from which they can be reached.
For example, if you create a tag named \[aq]important\[aq] under branch
\[aq]computerX\[aq], you will also be able to retrieve the contents of
the backup that was tagged under /computerX/important.
This is done as a convenience, and should the branch \[aq]computerX\[aq]
be deleted, the contents of the tagged backup will be available through
/.tag/important as long as the tag is not deleted.
