.SH NAME
.PP
bup \- Backup program using rolling checksums and git file formats
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
bup [global options...] <command> [options...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]bup\f[] is a program for making backups of your files using the git
file format.
.PP
Unlike \f[C]git\f[](1) itself, bup is optimized for handling huge data
sets including individual very large files (such a virtual machine
images).
However, once a backup set is created, it can still be accessed using
git tools.
.PP
The individual bup subcommands appear in their own man pages.
